  pattern of interactions.
* [`neighbourhoods`](reference/neighbourhoods.md) - Find the neighbourhoods where categories cluster.
* [`clustering`](reference/neighbourhoods.md) -  Compute the clustering index of categories.
* [`dissmilarity`](reference/evenness.md) - Compute the (traditional) dissimilarity index.
